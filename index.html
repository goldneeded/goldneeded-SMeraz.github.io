    <p>My name is Sergio Meraz I am from Richmond, CA. Moved to San Antonio, TX about a year ago. I started the UTSA Full Stack Boot Camp in the beginning of January. So far I am still developing my skills as a web developer and I will list my projects through this student bio that I have completed to show case my progress. What I enjoy most out of the program would have to be CSS. The program has been challenging since I don't have prior knowledge of web developing, but CSS have been enjoyable. My favorite thing is seen all the designing elements come together to form the idea I had in my head.</p>
